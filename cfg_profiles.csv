It was while I was in the US that I learnt about web programming and built my first web application - a simple site for keeping track of debts between friends. Over my time at Oxford I have tutored undergrad maths and given informal courses in web programming. I was also a member of the uni swimming team and MCR committee, both of which have given me plenty of opportunity to solve small problems using coding!","I'm interested in web programming because I want to start a web startup one day. One of the hardest thing about web programming is knowing where to start. I've mostly learnt through trial and error. I like to think that by sharing what I've found out so far, others will be able to learn far quicker.","Ruby (and sinatra). Ruby is a great language, is nice to program in and is very powerful. ","I'd be interested in contributing across the board, but am probably primarily a back-end developer.","http://code61.org/, http://code61-list-all-things.herokuapp.com/, http://sheltered-oasis-6836.herokuapp.com/","I'm going to be teaching part time (maths) in Oxford until Christmas. I'll use the rest of my time to develop the Oxford Code Lab - to provide coding courses to students over the course of their degrees - possibly also helping CodeFirst to set up similar things at other unis. I will probably also continue to work on the treasuring project (accountsy) that I've been working on the past few years, but might instead try to get some work experience in a startup."
